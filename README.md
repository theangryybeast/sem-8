# Driver Drowsiness Detection Using CNN-LSTM Fusion Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using a hybrid approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system leverages facial landmark detection and physiological signals to monitor driver fatigue and provide timely alerts, thereby enhancing road safety.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system processes live video frames to detect facial landmarks and determine the eye status (open or closed).
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines Haar Cascade for face detection, CNN for spatial feature extraction, and LSTM for temporal pattern recognition.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an accuracy of 95.1% in detecting driver drowsiness.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Utilizes data augmentation and adaptive learning rate adjustments to improve generalization.
- **Alert System**: Generates visual and auditory alerts to warn drivers when drowsiness is detected.

## Methodology

1. **Face and Eye Detection**: Haar Cascade is used to detect the driver's face and eyes in real-time video frames.
2. **Spatial Feature Extraction**: CNN extracts spatial features from the detected face and eye regions.
3. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: LSTM captures temporal dependencies across multiple frames to detect prolonged eye closure or irregular blinking patterns.
4. **Alert Generation**: If drowsiness is detected, the system triggers visual and auditory alerts to notify the driver.

## Datasets

- **Drowsiness Prediction Dataset**: Contains labeled images of individuals in drowsy and non-drowsy states, focusing on eye features and head position.
- **Prediction Images Dataset**: A supplementary collection of images depicting individuals in both drowsy and active states, used to enhance the diversity of the training set.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Image Resizing and Normalization**: All images are resized to 145x145 pixels and normalized to facilitate effective model training.
- **Facial Landmark Extraction**: Key facial points, especially around the eyes, are extracted using facial detection models.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, shift, zoom, and flip are applied to enhance the model's robustness and generalization ability.
- **Data Splitting**: The preprocessed data is divided into training and validation sets to ensure effective model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is a hybrid design that combines CNN and LSTM networks for classification into two categories: Fatigue Subjects and Active Subjects.

- **CNN Component**: Extracts spatial features from input data using convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers.
- **LSTM Component**: Captures temporal dependencies across sequential frames, enabling the model to detect patterns over time.
- **Output Layer**: Uses a sigmoid activation function to return binary predictions (fatigue or alertness).

## Training

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimal learning rates, dropout rates, and batch sizes are tuned for effective model training.
- **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment**: The learning rate is automatically reduced when validation performance plateaus, enhancing efficiency and generalization.
- **Callbacks**: Techniques like ReduceLROnPlateau are used to monitor validation loss and adaptively reduce the learning rate.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 95.1%
- **Precision**: 98.7%
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: 93.1%
- **Specificity**: 98.1%
- **F1-Score**: 95.1%

## Results

The model was trained for over 70 epochs and achieved high accuracy and low loss values. The confusion matrix showed a low rate of misclassifications, indicating the model's reliability in identifying facial fatigue-related cues.
